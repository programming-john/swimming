       <p>
       One of my main hobbies is swimming.
       Every summer, I have a lifeguarding job down at East Beach.
       Before my accident regarding my leg, I would swim for at least 2 hours a day.		
       However, this isn't the only thing that I have interest for. There are far more activities
       I love to participate in.
       </p>

       Here is a list of a few other things I have interest for...

         <th>Surfing</th>
         <th>Bicycling</th>
         <th>Kayaking</th>

       </tr>
       </p>
