      <p style="color:blue; font-size:125%">
        One of my main hobbies is swimming.
        Every summer, I have a lifeguarding job down at East Beach.
        Before my accident regarding my leg, I would swim for at least 2 hours a day.
		However, this isn't the only thing that I have interest for. There are far more activities
		I love to participate in.
