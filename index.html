        One of my main hobbies is swimming.
        Every summer, I have a lifeguarding job down at East Beach.
        Before my accident regarding my leg, I would swim for at least 2 hours a day.		
	However, this isn't the only thing that I have interest for. There are far more activities
	I love to participate in.

        </tr>
