        <p style="color:blue; font-size:125%">
        One of my main hobbies is swimming.
        Every summer, I have a lifeguarding job down at East Beach.
        Before my accident regarding my leg, I would swim for at least 2 hours a day.		
	However, this isn't the only thing that I have interest for. There are far more activities
	I love to participate in.
        </p>
        <p style="font-family:courier;">
        Here is a list of a few other things I have interest for...
        <tr bgcolor="powderblue"; style="color:#cc0099;">
         <th>Surfing</th>
         <th>Bicycling</th>
         <th>Kayaking</th>
	 <th>Baseball</th>
        </tr>
        </p>
     	<tr>     
         <th><img src="surf.jpg" alt="Swimming in the ocean." style="width:350px;height:264px;"></th>
         <th><img src="bike.jpg" alt="Riding my bike around Santa Barbara." style="width:350px;height:264px;"></th>
         <th><img src="kayak.jpg" alt="Kayaking in the vast ocean." style="width:350px;height:264px;"></th>
      	 <th><img src="baseball.png" alt="Playing baseball." style="width:275px;height:264px;"></th>
     	</tr>
       </table>
	<p font-size:"275%"; bgcolor:"green";>
	Now that I have shown my favorite activities, I will tell you more about my personal self. My favorite animal is the snow leopard.
	My favorite color is green. I have many allergies that consists of all dairy,
	and various types of nuts(with peanuts/peanut butter being the deadliest).
